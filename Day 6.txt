using System;

public class Problem
{
   public static void Main()
   {
	  DateTime today = DateTime.Now;
	  DateTime result = today.AddDays(40);
	  
	  Console.WriteLine("Today: {0}",today.ToString("D"));
	  Console.WriteLine("40 days after today: {0}", result.ToString("D"));
     }   
 }

O/P: Today: Thursday, April 20, 2023
40 days after today: Tuesday, May 30, 2023

3] Write a C# Sharp program that compares two dates.

using System;

public class Problem
{
   public static void Main()
   {
	  DateTime date1 = new DateTime(2023, 03, 12, 0, 0, 0);
	  DateTime date2 = new DateTime(2023, 03, 12, 12, 0, 0);
	  int result = DateTime.Compare(date1, date2);
	  string relationship;
	   
	  if(result < 0)
		relationship = "is earlier than";
	  else if(result == 0)
		relationship = "is same time as";  
	  else
		relationship = "is later than";
	  
	  Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}", date1, relationship, date2);
     }   
 }

O/P: 03/12/2023 12:00:00 AM is earlier than 3/12/2023 12:00:00 PM

4] Write a C# Sharp program to get the difference between two dates in days.

using System;

public class Problem
{
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 DateTime start = new DateTime(2010, 6, 14);
	 DateTime end = new DateTime(2016, 08, 14);

	 TimeSpan difference = end - start; 

   	 Console.WriteLine("Difference in days: " + difference.Days); 
   }
}

O/P: Difference in days: 2253

5] Write a program in C# Sharp to compute what day was yesterday.

using System;

public class Problem
{
   static DateTime GetYesterday()
   {
	   return DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1);
   }
   
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 Console.WriteLine("Today is {0}", DateTime.Today.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
	 DateTime yest = GetYesterday();
	 Console.WriteLine("Yesterday was {0}", yest.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
   }
}

O/P: Today is 28/04/2023
Yesterday was 27/04/2023

6] Write a program in C# Sharp to compute what day will be tomorrow. 

using System;

public class Problem
{
   static DateTime GetYesterday()
   {
	   return DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
   }
   
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 Console.WriteLine("Today is {0}", DateTime.Today.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
	 DateTime tmrw = GetYesterday();
	 Console.WriteLine("Tomorrow is {0}", tmrw.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
   }
}

O/P: Today is 28/04/2023
Tomorrow is 29/04/2023

7] Write a program in C# Sharp to get the day and month name of current date.

using System;

public class Problem
{
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
	 Console.WriteLine("Current month number is {0}", now.Month);
	 Console.WriteLine("Currnt month is {0}", now.ToString("MMMM"));
   }
}

O/P: Current month number is 4
Currnt month is April

8] Write a program in C# Sharp to print the name of the first three letters of month of a year starting form current date.

using System;

public class Problem
{
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
	 Console.WriteLine("Th date of today is {0}", now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
	 Console.WriteLine("Tweleve months are:");
	  
	 for(int i=0; i<12; i++)
	 {
		 Console.WriteLine("{0}", now.ToString("MMM"));
		 now = now.AddMonths(1);
	 }
	 Console.WriteLine();
   }
}

O/P: The date of today is 28/04/2023
Tweleve months are:
Apr
May

Jul
Aug
Sep
Oct
Nov
Dec

{
   public static void Main()
   { 
	 DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
	 Console.WriteLine("The date of today is {0}", now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"));
	 Console.WriteLine("Tweleve months are:");
	  
	 for(int i=0; i<12; i++)
	 {
		 Console.WriteLine("{0}", now.ToString("MMMM"));
		 now = now.AddMonths(1);
	 }
	 Console.WriteLine();
   }
}
